# Framework

There comes a time in everyone's life when they need to write their own framework. This is mine, but this framework's motivation is as follows:

* To learn: I want to dissect specific bits from other frameworks
* To teach: I want to teach other folks who can look at this code

This framework is **not intended for production purposes**.
